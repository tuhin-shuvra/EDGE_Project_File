A Spam Email & SMS Detector using Machine Learning. Utilizes Pandas for data processing, Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualization, and Scikit-learn for classification. Detects and classifies messages as spam or ham with high accuracy through text analysis and ML modeling.

Spam SMS/Email Classifier:

This project is a machine learning model that classifies SMS or Email messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam).

It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF/Bag of Words), model training with classifiers, and evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

To use this project, place the dataset file (e.g., spam.csv) in the same folder as the notebook, install required libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, matplotlib), and run the Jupyter Notebook.

The notebook works in Jupyter, VS Code, and Google Colab (dataset path may need adjustment).

The trained model shows good performance in detecting spam and can be improved further with advanced techniques.

The dataset was collected for 'Kaggle'. Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset
